# picProcessCNN
Uses pretrained CNNs to extract embeddings from pictures and compares them to human-made similarity ratings.
Dimensionality reduction is performed on the embeddings using UMAP. Also data transformation is performed using PCA.

Note: This was the first bigger project this is why there are many comments about Python functionalities for learning purposes.
